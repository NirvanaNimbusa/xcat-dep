This information is to build postgresql 9.1.X on a Redhat6 machine.  postgresql9.1 will not officially be in a distro until Redhat7 and SLES 12, so for PCM to use it we need to build for the current Redhat6.3 which we will release xCAT/PCM produce.

1) Also need to install rpmbuild from the disto and gcc on  your build machine
2)Must have uuid_devel, does not see to be in the Redhat6.3 distro soo.....
So downloaded  from 
  http://pkgs.org/centos-6-rhel-6/centos-rhel-x86_64/uuid-devel-1.6.1-10.el6.x86_64.rpm/download/
3)used this website to download src rpms
http://yum.postgresql.org/srpms/9.1/redhat/rhel-6-x86_64/
From here I got postgresql91-9.1.5-1PGDG.rhel6.src.rpm

4)Run rpm -ivh postgresql91-9.1.5-1PGDG.rhel6.src.rpm

uuid-devel-1.6.1-10.el6.x86_64.rpm   and installed.

5)When  you installed the source rpm, it put the data in /root/rpmbuild
cd /root/rpmbuild/SPECS
cp postgresql-9.1.spec postgresql-9.1.spec.org
We have modified the spec that Fedora16 used to build postgresql91, so 
that all the commands and code will go in the normal locations and provide 
that spec here
cp postgresql-9.1.spec in this directory to /root/rpmbuild/SPECS 

6) build  the rpms
rpmbuild -ba postgresql-9.1.spec
