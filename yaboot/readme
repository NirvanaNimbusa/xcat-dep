Patchs overview:

These patches are no use now:
1. yaboot-skipmac.patch--done
    This patch is used to skip using mac address in the configuration file.
    Since the P775 will use the mac address in the configuration file, I think it is no use anymore.

    The newest official yaboot build has contained this patch.
3. yaboot-1.3.14-better_netboot.patch

4. yaboot-1.3.14-ipv6.patch

5. yaboot-fixes.patch

6. yaboot-1.3.14-better_netboot2.patch
    The newest official yaboot build has contained this patch.
7. yaboot-1.3.14-move_kernel.patch
    Free the TFTP load buffer so the booted kernel has some memory to run with. It is no use for 3.17-rc1 yaboot build.

These patches will be used in the new build.
1. yaboot-32bitbuild.patch   
    Add the "-m32" compiler switch to tell GCC to compile user code as 32-bit.
2. yaboot-sanedhcppriority.patch 
    Use the mask and gateway from bootp package to overwrite the existed boot-path. 
    I've no idea about the reason of this patch, and don't think it is a necessary patch but still leave it here.    
   
New patches:
1. yaboot-promclaim.patch
    Claime big size on pROM for the large initrd file.
