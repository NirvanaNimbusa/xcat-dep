Build Notes
Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Download Crypt-SSLeay-0.57.tar.gz from CPAN.

Write a copy of the gz file to /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES.

Unwrap the tar file in a temporary directory. (gunzip & tar -xvf  )

Go to the subdirectory containing the Makefile and run "cpan2rpm ." 

This will eventually fail but it does produce a spec file. 

Modify the spec file and put it in  /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS.

Run "rpm -bb Crypt-SSLeay.spec", which creates:
 /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-Crypt-SSLeay-0.57-1.aix5.3.ppc.rpm
