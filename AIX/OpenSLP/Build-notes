Build Notes

You will need the gcc compiler which can be downloaded from the AIX Toolbox 
for Linux Applications.  (http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/p/os/aix/linux)

Download openslp-1.2.1.tar.gz from http://openslp.org/download.html.

Copy the gz file to /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES.  Also copy 
openslp-aix.patch (provided in AIX openslp directory of the xCAT SVN 
repository) and openslp-conf.patch, openslp-network.patch, and 
openslp-attr.patch (provided in the Linux openslp directory of the xCAT 
SVN repository) to /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES.  

Copy the openslp.spec file to /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS.

Download and install the "patch" command from 
"http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/p/os/aix/linux/toolbox/download.html". 
The "patch" command that comes with AIX (including AIX 6.1) is an older 
version which only supports standard "diff" format patches. The  
patch is NOT in standard "diff" format.

Run "rpm -bb openslp.spec", which creates:
/opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/openslp-1.2.1-1.aix5.3.ppc.rpm


NOTE #1
This package is installed to /usr/local so as to not interfer
with other versions of OpenSLP that may already be installed.
For example, SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server 9 comes w/ OpenSLP 1.1.5.
Even though there may not be other OpenSLP versions installed on AIX,
still install in /usr/local to keep it consistent with Linux install.

NOTE #2
HOW TO CREATE THESE PATCHES
1) cd /tmp/openslp-1.2.1
2) mkdir a (this directory contains the original file)
3) Copy original file to "a" subdirectory
4) Repeat above for directory "b" (this directory contains the changed file)
5) Copy changed file to "b" subdirectory
6) cd /tmp/openslp-1.2.1
7) diff -uNr a b > openslp.patch
