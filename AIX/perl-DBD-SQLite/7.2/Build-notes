Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Use the DBD-SQLite.spec in this directory 
( it was created by running a modified cpan2rpm to support AIX)
Get DBD-SQLite-1.48.tar.gz from CPAN
cp DBD-SQLite-1.48.tar.gz /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES
cp DBD-SQLite.spec /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS

Run "rpm -bb DBD-SQLite.spec".
 - which creates: /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-Debug-trace-1.48.aix7.2.ppc.rpm
