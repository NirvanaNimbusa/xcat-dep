Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.
Need PostgreSQL installed
Use the DBD-Pg.spec in this directory 
( it was created by running a modified cpan2rpm to support AIX)
Get DBD-Pg-2.17.1.tar.gz from CPAN
cp DBD-Pg-2.17.1.tar.gz /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES
cp DBD-Pg.spec /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS

Run "rpm -bb DBD-Pg.spec".
 - which creates: /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-DBD-Pg-2-17.1.aix6.1.ppc.rpm
