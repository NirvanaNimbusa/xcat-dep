Build Notes  for the perl-DBD-Pg on AIX 6.1

Need  cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system and in /bin. 

Download DBD-Pg-2.17.1.tar.gz from CPAN.
Unwrap the tar file. (gunzip & tar -xvf  ) in some directory

Go to the subdirectory containing the Makefile of the unwrapped tar file,
 and run "/usr/opt/perl5/bin/cpan2rpm --author xcat --version 2 ."

This will eventually fail but it does produce a spec file in /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS. 
Modify the spec file as needed.   Change the name.  See DBD-Pg.spec.


Put the DBD-Pg-2.17.1.tar.gz file in /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES.

Go to /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS and run
"rpm -bb DBD-Pg.spec", which creates:

/opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-DBD-Pg-2.17.1-1.aix6.1.ppc.rpm
