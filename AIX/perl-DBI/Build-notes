Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Download DBI-1.55.tar.gz from CPAN.

Use cpan2rpm to create basic spec file. (The cpan2rpm command fails but
produces the spec file first.)

Modify the spec file.  (The modified file is in this directory.)

Run "rpm -bb DBI.spec".
 - which created: /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-DBI-1.55-1.aix5.3.ppc.rpm
