Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Get DBI-1.634.tar.gz from CPAN 
Use the DBI.spec in this directory ( it was created by running a modified   
 cpan2rpm to support AIX)

cp DBI-1.634.tar.gz /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES
cp DBI.spec /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS

Run "rpm -bb DBI.spec".
 - which creates: /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-DBI-1.634-1.aix7.2.ppc.rpm
