Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Get XML-Simple-2.22.tar.gz  from CPAN
se the  XML-Simple.spec in this directory ( it was created by running a modified   
 cpan2rpm to support AIX)

cp XML-Simple-2.22.tar.gz /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES
cp XML-Simple.spec /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS

Run "rpm -bb XML-Simple.spec".
 - which creates: /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/XML-Simple-2.22-1.aix7.2.ppc.rpm
