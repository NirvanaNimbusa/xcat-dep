The following is a list of open source software that is either required or 
optional when using xCAT on AIX. Please review this list to make sure there 
are no conflicts with any software currently installed on your system.

The openssl-0.9.8 and openssh-4.5 software is available as AIX installp
filesets.  They are contained on the AIX Expansion pack and also can be
found on the following web site: http://sourceforge.net.  Note that some of
the other RPM packages have a dependency on this level of openssl.  Also,
since these are installp filesets you should run /usr/sbin/updtvpkg to make
sure that RPM's reflection of what was installed by installp is updated.  If
you don't do this you could get dependency errors when installing some of 
the RPM packages.

The rest of the required software listed below is provided in the
dep-aix-2.2-snap*.tar.gz tar file.

The optional MySQL packages are provided in a separate tar file 
(xcat-mysql-2.2-snap*.tar.gz) as a convenience for when you wish
to use the xCAT service node support. The xcat-mysql package contains the
MySQL 64 bit gz file that was downloaded from
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql and included in an xCAT RPM to make
the installation of MySQL easier.

These tar files are available from the xCAT web site: 
http://xcat.sourceforge.net/

They are all RPM packages that have been built for AIX. They can be 
installed on AIX version 5.3 or 6.1.

which is included as a convenience.

The dep-aix-2.2-snap*.tar.gz file also includes three AIX bundle files
that can be used when setting up the AIX Network Installation Manager (NIM), 
when preparing to install cluster nodes.  
xCATaixSSL.bnd - contains a list of OpenSSL installp filesets.
xCATaixSSH.bnd - contains a list of OpenSSH installp filesets.
xCATaixSN.bnd - contains a list of software (installp & RPM) required for
		xCAT service nodes.

The tk, tcl, expect, and bash packages come from the "AIX Toolbox for Linux 
Applications" web site. (http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/p/os/aix/linux).  The 
packages have been included here for your convenience.  For details on 
the source and licenses etc. please refer to the Toolbox site.

The "perl-*" software is all available from http://search.cpan.org under the 
Artistic license for Perl. The source was downloaded from the CPAN site and
RPMs were built for AIX.

The conserver software was downloaded from http://www.conserver.com/ and 
the RPM was built for AIX with a few minor modifications.

The fping software was downloaded from http://fping.sourceforge.net/ and the 
RPM was built for AIX.

The openslp-1.2.1 software was downloaded from http://openslp.org/download.html
and the RPM was built for AIX.
