Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system. 

Download Debug-Trace-0.04.tar.gz from CPAN.

Unwrap the tar file. (gunzip & tar -xvf  )

Go to the subdirectory containing the Makefile and run "cpan2rpm ." 
This will eventually fail but it does produce a spec file. Modify the spec
file and put it in  /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS. Put the gz file in 
/opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES.

Modify the spec file.  (The modified file is in this directory.)

Run "rpm -bb Debug-Trace.spec", which creates:
 /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-Debug-Trace*.aix*.ppc.rpm
