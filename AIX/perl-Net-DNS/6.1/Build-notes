Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Use the  Net-DNS.spec  in this directory 
( it was created by running a modified cpan2rpm to support AIX)
Get Net-DNS-0.66.tar.gz from CPAN
cp  Net-DNS-0.66.tar.gz /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES
cp  Net-DNS.spec /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS

Run "rpm -bb  Net-DNS.spec".
 - which creates: /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-Net-DNS-0.66-1.aix6.1.ppc.rpm
