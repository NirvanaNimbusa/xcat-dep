Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Download Net-IP-1.25.tar.gz from CPAN.

Unwrap the tar file. (gunzip & tar -xvf  )

Go to the subdirectory containing the Makefile and run "cpan2rpm ."
This will eventually fail but it does produce a spec file.

Modify the spec file and put it in  /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS.
Put the gz file in /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES.

Note: cpan2rpm produced a spec file that was different than all the other
cpan spec files.  I could not build the rpm with it.  Instead I copied
the standard spec file from the Net-DNS package and modified the names etc.
This spec file worked.

The modified file is in this directory.

Run "rpm -bb Net-IP.spec", which creates:
 /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-Net-IP-1.25-1.aix5.3.ppc.rpm
