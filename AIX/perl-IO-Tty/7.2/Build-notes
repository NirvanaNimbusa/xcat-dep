Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Get IO-Tty-1.12.tar.gz  from CPAN
se the  IO-Tty.spec in this directory ( it was created by running a modified   
 cpan2rpm to support AIX)

cp IO-Tty-1.12.tar.gz /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES
cp IO-Tty.spec /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS

Run "rpm -bb IO-Tty.spec".
 - which creates: /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/IO-Tty-1.12-1.aix7.2.ppc.rpm
