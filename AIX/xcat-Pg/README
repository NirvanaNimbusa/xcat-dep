This xCAT-Postgresql tarball contains the two rpms necessary to install
the Postgresql Database and perl DBD on AIX 61J (AIX61 TL5) or later
for xCAT to use as it's database.
This support is available on AIX for the xCAT2.5 release or later.  There is a 
automated setup script pgsqlsetup in that release that will aid in the
migration to Postgresql on AIX or Linux.  

See the latest xCAT PostgeSQL install and setup instructions at
http://xcat.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/xcat/xcat-core/trunk/xCAT-client/share/doc/xCAT2SetupPostgresql.pdf. 

To install
 rpm -Uvh xcat-postgresql-8.4-4.aix6.1.ppc.rpm
 rpm -Uvh 6.1/perl-DBD-Pg-2-17.1.aix6.1.ppc.rpm
