Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Use the Net-Telnet.spec  in this directory 
( it was created by running a modified cpan2rpm to support AIX)
Get Net-Telnet-3.04.tar.gz from CPAN
cp Net-Telnet-3.04.tar.gz /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES
cp Net-Telnet.spec /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS

Run "rpm -bb Net-Telnet.spec".
 - which creates: /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-Net-Telnet-3.04-1.aix7.2.ppc.rpm
