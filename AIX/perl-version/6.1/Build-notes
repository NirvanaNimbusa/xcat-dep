Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Use the version.spec in this directory 
( it was created by running a modified cpan2rpm to support AIX)
Get  version-0.82.tar.gz from CPAN
cp  version-0.82.tar.gz  /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES
cp version.spec /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS

Run "rpm -bb version.spec".
 - which creates: /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-version-0.82-1.aix6.1.ppc.rpm
