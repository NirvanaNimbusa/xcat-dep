Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Use the  Digest-MD5.spec   in this directory 
( it was created by running a modified cpan2rpm to support AIX)
Get Digest-MD5-2.54.tar.gz from cpan.
cp  Digest-MD5-2.54.tar.gz /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES
cp  Digest-MD5.spec   /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS

Run "rpm -bb Digest-MD5.spec ".
 - which creates: /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-Digest-MD5-2.54-1.aix7.2.ppc.rpm
