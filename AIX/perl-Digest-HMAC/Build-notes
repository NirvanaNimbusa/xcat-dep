Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Download Digest-HMAC-1.01.tar.gz from CPAN.

Unwrap the tar file. (gunzip & tar -xvf  )

Go to the subdirectory containing the Makefile and run "cpan2rpm ."
This will eventually fail but it does produce a spec file.

Modify the spec file and put it in  /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS.
Put the gz file in /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES.

The modified file is in this directory.

Run "rpm -bb Digest-HMAC.spec", which creates:
 /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/perl-Digest-HMAC-1.01-1.aix5.3.ppc.rpm
