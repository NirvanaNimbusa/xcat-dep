Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Use the Digest-HMAC.spec in this directory 
( it was created by running a modified cpan2rpm to support AIX)
Get Digest-HMAC-1.02.tar.gz from CPAN
cp Digest-HMAC-1.02.tar.gz /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES
cp Digest-HMAC.spec  /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS

Run "rpm -bb Digest-HMAC.spec".
 - which creates: /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-Digest-HMAC-1.02-2.aix7.1.ppc.rpm
