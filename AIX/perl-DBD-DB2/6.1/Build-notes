Build Notes  for the perl-DBD-DB2 on AIX 6.1

Need  cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system and in /bin.
 
DB2 must be installed on the machine to build the DBD
 
export DB2_HOME to the install path of DB2.
IF this path is differenct the DBD-DB2.spec file must change.
export DB2_HOME=/opt/IBM/db2/V9.7
 
Download DBD-DB2-1.78.tar.gz from CPAN.
 
cp DBD-DB2-1.78.tar.gz /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES
Use the DBD-DB2.spec file in this directory
cp DBD-DB2.spec /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS
cp Makefile.db2 from this directory to /tmp
Go to /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS and run
"rpm -bb DBD-DB2.spec", which creates:

/opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-DBD-DB2.aix6.1.ppc.rpm

Note this rpm must be installed with --nodeps, since DB2 does not provide an
rpm or installp to satisfy the generated requirements.
