Build Notes

You will need the gcc compiler which can be downloaded from the AIX Toolbox 
for Linux Applications.  (http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/p/os/aix/linux)

Will will also need the openssl-0.9.8 installp  fileset available from AIX.
It is available on the AIX Expansion pack and also can be found on the
following web site: http://sourceforge.net.  After installing the openssl 
fileset make sure you run /usr/sbin/updtvpkg to update RPM's reflection of 
what is installed.

Download conserver-8.1.16.tar.gz from http://www.conserver.com/.

Copy the gz file to /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES.  Also copy 
certificate-auth.patch to /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES.  This patch file
is provided in the Linux conserver directory of the xCAT SVN repository.

Copy the conserver.spec file to /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS.

Run "rpm -bb conserver.spec", which creates:
 /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/conserver-8.1.16-2.aix5.3.ppc.rpm
