Build Notes

You will need the gcc compiler which can be downloaded from the AIX Toolbox 
for Linux Applications.  (http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/p/os/aix/linux)

Will will also need the openssl-0.9.8 installp  fileset available from AIX.
It is available on the AIX Expansion pack and also can be found on the
following web site: http://sourceforge.net.  After installing the openssl 
fileset make sure you run /usr/sbin/updtvpkg to update RPM's reflection of 
what is installed.

Download conserver-8.1.16.tar.gz from http://www.conserver.com/.

Copy the gz file to /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES.  Also copy 
certificate-auth.patch to /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES.  This patch file
is provided in the Linux conserver directory of the xCAT SVN repository.

Copy the conserver.spec file to /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS.

Download and install the "patch" command from 
"http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/p/os/aix/linux/toolbox/download.html". 
The "patch" command that comes with AIX (including AIX 6.1) is an older 
version which only supports standard "diff" format patches. The conserver 
patch is NOT in standard "diff" format.

The new "patch" command will be installed in "opt/freeware/bin", so prior 
to building the conserver RPM, put the new "patch" command at the
front of the path (i.e. "export PATH=/opt/freeware/bin:$PATH ).
       
Run "rpm -bb conserver.spec", which creates:
 /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/conserver-8.1.16-2.aix5.3.ppc.rpm
