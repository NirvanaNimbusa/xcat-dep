Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Use the Digest-SHA.spec  in this directory.
( it was created by running a modified cpan2rpm to support AIX)
Get  Digest-SHA-5.48.tar.gz from CPAN
cp Digest-SHA-5.48.tar.gz /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES
cp Digest-SHA.spec /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS

Run "rpm -bb Digest-SHA.spec".
 - which creates: /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-Digest-SHA-5.48-3.aix7.1.ppc.rpm
