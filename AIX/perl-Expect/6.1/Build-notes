Build Notes

Need cc_r compiler installed on AIX build system.

Use the Expect.spec in this directory 
( it was created by running a modified cpan2rpm to support AIX)
Get Expect-1.21.tar.gz from CPAN
cp Expect-1.21.tar.gz  /opt/freeware/src/packages/SOURCES
cp Expect.spec /opt/freeware/src/packages/SPECS

Run "rpm -bb Expect.spec".
 - which creates: /opt/freeware/src/packages/RPMS/ppc/perl-Expect-1.21-1.aix6.1.ppc.rpm
