Build Notes
===========

1. Place the gunzipped source package into the SOURCES directory, e.g. /usr/src/packages
2. Place the build SPEC file into the SPECS directory, e.g. /usr/src/SPECS
3. Invoke the rpmbuild command, i.e. rpmbuild -ba -v SPECS/zhcp.spec
The RPMs will be placed under the RPMS directory, e.g. /usr/src/packages/RPMS/s390x/zhcp-*.s390x.rpm
