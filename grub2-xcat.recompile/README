The latest source rpm file of grub2 can be obtained from the source codes of
the Red Hat Enterprse Linux. The current source rpm file,
grub2-2.02-0.16.xcat.src.rpm, was obtained from RHEL 7.1 Alpha with a little
modification. When a new source rpm file is available, please update the
Makefile accordingly. And the Version and Release sections in the template
of the spec file, grub2-xcat.spec.template should also be updated.

For rpm package compling, a RHEL 7 environment on powerpc64 is needed.

For deb package generating, a Debian or Ubunutu environment on any architecture
should work. It will re-pack the grub2-xcat.noarch.rpm to deb package. Thus,
the rpm package must be compiled at first.
